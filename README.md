I am learning rust. To learn it most efficiently, I am - solving problems here https://practice.course.rs/compound-types/enum.html - and following this video to clarify concepts https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpPEoZW5IiY&t=14214s

I finished till chapter 6 and then started working on projets. I know concepts like generics and other memory management stuff from Java, Solitidy so I skipped to building stuff. If you don't have these basics covered, I would highly recommend you finish the practise book first.

I like to build projects while learning so here are some projects I implemented in this repo

This is in Go so you can't just copy it. I used chat gpt to convert some parts of it in Rust and a lot of it I wrote on my own
